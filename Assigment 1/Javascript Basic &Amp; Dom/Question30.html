    <div class="container fs-4 mt-5">
        <li>JavaScript loops are essential for efficiently handling repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li> They execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true.</li>
        <li>These loops are powerful tools for automating tasks and streamlining your code.</li>
        <li>There are many types of loops in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>(1)For loop: The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.</li>
        <li>(2)While loop: The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.</li>
        <li>(3)Do-while loop: The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once.</li>
        <li>(4)For in loop: The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.</li>
        <li>(5)For of loop: The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.).</li>
        <li>Example of for loop:</li>

        for(let i=0; i < 5; i++){
            document.write(i + "<br>")
