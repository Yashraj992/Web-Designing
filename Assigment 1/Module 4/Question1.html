    <h1>(1)What are the benefits of using CSS?</h1>
    <h2>Ans:-</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>
        (1)CSS saves time -
        <li>You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</li>
        <li>You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</li>
        <br>
        (2)Pages load faster -
        <li>If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time.</li>
        <li>Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag.</li>
        <br>
        (3)Easy maintenance -
        <li>To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
        <br>
        (4)Superior styles to HTML -
        <li>CSS has a much wider array of attritubutes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
        <br>
        (5)Multiple Device Compability -
        <li>Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device.</li>
        <li>By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.</li>
