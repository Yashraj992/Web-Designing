    <h1>(10)Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h1>
    <h2>Ans:</h2>
    <h3>
        There are two reasons behind this:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            It enhances the legibility of style sheets.
            <br> The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Color is an inherited property while the background is not.
            <br>
            So this can make confusion further.
