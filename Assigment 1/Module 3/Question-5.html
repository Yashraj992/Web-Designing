    <h1>What are different type of lists in HTML?With Example.</h1>
    <h2>
    Ans:-
    <pre>
        There are three list types in HTML:
        (1)Unorderd list=
         - used to group a set of related items in no particular order.
         - Unorderd lists are used when a set of items can be placed in any order.
         - ul  ->Unorderd List
         - li  ->List Item
           Ex:- 
            <h3>Shopping list</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Pizza</li>
            </ul>
         - Although the items are all part of one list, you could put the items in any order and the list would still make sense:
           Ex:-
         <ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Pizza</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        (2)Ordered List=
         - Ordered lists are used to display a list of items that  should be in a specific order.
         - ol ->Ordered List
         - li ->List item
         Ex:-
          <h3>Month name</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>January</li>
            <li>Fabruary</li>
            <li>March</li>
            <li>April</li>
            <li>May</li>
            <li>June</li>
            <li>July</li>
            <li>August</li>
            <li>September</li>
            <li>Octomber</li>
            <li>November</li>
            <li>December</li>
          </ol>

         - If the list items were moved around into a different order, the information would no longer make sense:
         
         <ol>
            <li>Fabruary</li>
            <li>April</li>
            <li>May</li>
            <li>July</li>
            <li>August</li>
            <li>September</li>
            <li>Octomber</li>
            <li>November</li>
            <li>December</li>
            <li>January</li>
            <li>March</li>
            <li>June</li>
         </ol>
        - Ordered lists can be displayed with several sequencing options.
          =>Letters
              (a,b,c....)
              (A,B,C....)
          =>Numbers 
              (1,2,3....)
              (I, II, III...)   
         <hr>
        (3)Discripion List=
         - used to diplay name/value pairs such as terms and definitions.
         - It's used tp diplay data and their defination.
         - dl ->Data list
         - dt ->Data term
         - dd ->Data defination
           Ex:-
           <h3>Dogs List</h3>
           <dl>
            <dt>La Pom</dt>
            <dd>The La Pom is a newer crossbreed composed from two older and long-beloved breeds, developed for dog parents who need a small and playful companion.</dd>
            <dt>Huskita</dt>
            <dd>The Huskita is a mixed breed dog â€” a cross between the Akita and Siberian Husky dog breeds. Large, energetic, and loyal, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.</dd>
