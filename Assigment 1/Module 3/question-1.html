2.Non pair/void tag

(1) Pair tag:- 
  - Pair tags are tags with both opening and closing. They can have child tags, parent tag and attributes.
  - A pair must be close.
  - For example :- p, div, span, u...

(2) Non pair tag:- 
 - HTML non paired tag if any html tag has both opening and closing tag in a single tag,then such html tag 
 - is known as non paired tag.
 - For example:-br, meta, hr, img, link
                 

                 
ELEMENTS

- HTML element is a component of an html document that tells a web browser how to structure and interpret a part of the html document.
  html element can contain fromatting instruction, semantic meaning , and content

  - Element is a combination of the opening and closing tag,and then the content between them.
    
      - EX:-&lt;start tag&gt;content&lt;/end tag&gt;  

- Elements types
  1.Block element  2. Inline element   
  
  (1) Block element:- 
  - block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before
   and after the element.
  - block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

  Ex:-  &lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;

(2) Inline element :- 
    - inline element does not start on a new line and  only takes up as much width as necessary This is a &lt;span&gt;
      element inside a paragraph.
      
      
      Ex:- &lt;a&gt;,&lt;b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
