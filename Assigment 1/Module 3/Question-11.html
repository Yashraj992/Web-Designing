    <h1>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h1>
    <h2>
        Ans:-
        <pre>
           - Block elements always start from a new line and inline elements never start from a new line.
           - Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go.
           - Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
 
           <b>1.Block-level element</b>
            - A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space before and after the element.
            - A block-level element always takes up the full width available.
           <b>2.Inline element</b>
            - An inline element does not start on a new line.
            - An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
        </pre>
