<h1>
Que-4   What are HTML Entities? With Example. 
</h1>
<h2>
    <pre>
Ans:- 
      ENTITIES:- 
           HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). 
           Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code),
           and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). 
           
           Ex:- Many characters have memorable entities. For example, the entity for the copyright symbol (Â©) is &copy;.
                For less memorable characters, such as  &#8212;, &#x2014;, &lt;,&gt;
