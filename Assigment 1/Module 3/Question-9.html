    <h1>How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h1>
    <h2>
        Ans:-
        <pre>
          - Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content present in it.
          - Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells.

        <b>=>Cellpadding:-</b>
         - cellpadding is the attribute which is used to set the whitespace between the cell edge and the cell content.
         - In simple words, cellpadding is the attribute of the table tag that set the distance between the cell border and cell content.

           Ex:-
            <table border="1px" cellpadding="10px">
                <tr>
                    <th>Rank</th>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Score</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>Jatin</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>ketul</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        <b>=>Cellspacing:-</b>
         - It is used to control the distance between two adjacent cells.
         - It is primary used to improve the clarity of the table.

          Ex:-
          <table border="1px" cellspacing="10px">
            <tr>
                <th>Rank</th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Score</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Jatin</td>
                <td>8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>ketul</td>
                <td>6</td>
            </tr>
