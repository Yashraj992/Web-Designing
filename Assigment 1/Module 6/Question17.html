    <h1>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2>Ans:-</h2>

    <div>
        <p>&#10233 The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.</p>
        <p>&#10233 You add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.</p>
        <p>&#10233 :+= is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an HTML tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.</p>
        <p>&#10233 There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used.</p>
        <p>&#10233 This may break the document of JavaScript.</p>
        <p>&#10233 Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.</p>
