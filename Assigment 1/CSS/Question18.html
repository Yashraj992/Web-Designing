    <h1>(18)What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h1>
    <h2>Ans:</h2>
    <h3>
        One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on paper, with a speech,etc.
        We have four ways to specify media types for style sheets-
        <ol>
            <li>all:- Used for all media type devices.</li>
            <li>Print:- Used for printers</li>
            <li>Screen:- Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.</li>
            <li>Speech:- Used for scrrenreaders that "reads" yhe page out loud.</li>
        </ol>
        One way to use media queries is to have an alternate CSS section right inside your style sheet.
        <br><br>
        Example:
        <pre>
        @media screen and (min-width:500px)
          {
            body{
                 background-color: red
                }
            
          }</pre>
